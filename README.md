# Prescheduled-Mails
This is group project made by 6 people in collaboration using Python.
This code helps us to send mails in the future.
it needs an excel sheet to run, in which we need to add the date-time and the recipient's mail address on which the mail is supposed to be sent on the entered time and date, as well as the content of the mail is to be entered..
